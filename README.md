# Syllabuddy

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## Getting Started
We're going to be using the most up to date versions of Angular and npm.

First we'll need to make sure to install the latest version of Angular (with all the helpful CLI commands)


`npm i -g @angular/cli`


Now we need to make sure npm is completely updated so go ahead and run


`npm i -g npm`


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. Include `--aot` as well!

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
